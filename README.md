# pygmailvoice

Pygooglevoice stopped working for me a few months back, so I built this quick and dirty substitute that uses gmail to see and respond to messages on Google Voice.

When setting this up, it is necessary to have your Google Voice account forward all incoming messages to a gmail account (look for this under the Google Voice account settings)

If you are looking to send automated responses, the code currently looks to find these responses on a google spreadsheet, you can find the doc for the language here (https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
